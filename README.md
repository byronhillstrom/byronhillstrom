**byronhillstrom/byronhillstrom** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graduatin university
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics
- âš¡ Fun fact: Bananas are naturally radioactive. They contain potassium, and a small fraction of potassium is the radioactive isotope potassium-40. Don't worry, though; you would need to eat an exorbitant number of bananas in a short amount of time for the radioactivity to have any noticeable effect on your health.
